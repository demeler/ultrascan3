$ perl pdfmanual.pl
will make the manual from $ULTRASCAN/doc/manual/somo into out/somo_hplc.pdf

if you wish to add or change the order of the html files included, edit somo_hplc.txt


note: the utility for making the PDF relies on the html H tags, e.g. <h1></h1>, <h2>...</h2> for making table of contents (toc) and their links
I have programatically removed the <h1>Manual</h1> from the source html to avoid repeated "Manual" toc entries.
The other one is the "last date" ... we could remove this also if you wish

We can also easily add other groups of files (for example make a somo_hydrodynamics.txt file with the list and I can add this to the pdfmanual.pl code to be read
