cluster by backbone rmsd differences
for each group determine pairwise rmsd distances of backbone of all atoms (resno's should be ok now).
any pair within a threshold should be clustered
then find lowest haddock score of group

cluster:
python /src/rmsd-master/calculate_rmsd.py try10_1-B.xyz try10_1-B.xyz 

https://github.com/charnley/rmsd for calculate_rmsd.py

to isolate chains:
doublemods.pl 
 -> calls splittochains.pl
stripto1.pl 
 -> finds closest tgfb
cluster.pl
 -> creates outputfile cluster_res.txt

find pairs of results in each group that are below a threshold ... cluster together

structures within threshold distance gets joined to a cluster and

clusterdo.pl

bring in haddock score and report cluster statistics of haddock score
e.g.:
/haddock/bin/clusterdo.pl 2 try1?/1/{,water/}cluster_res.txt

structures_haddock-sorted.stat 
file.nam_haddock-score

make haddock-score / cat all the file.nam_haddock-score files

for each cluster: get the scores, get min & avg scores, rank the clusters by min haddock score

/haddock/bin/clusterdom.pl 1 10 .5 try1?/1/{,water/}cluster_res.txt
